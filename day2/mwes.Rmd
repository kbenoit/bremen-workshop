## Irish Budget Speeches

In **quanteda**, we use the function `textstat_collocations()` to estimate the likelihood of co-occurrence of word sequences.

```{r}
tstat_col <- data_corpus_irishbudget2010 %>% 
    tokens() %>% 
    textstat_collocations(min_count = 20, tolower = TRUE)

head(tstat_col, 7)
```


### Exercise

1. Repeat the step above, but remove stopwords, and stem the `tokens` object.
2. Compare the most frequent collocations. What has changed?
3. Try the second step again, with `padding = TRUE`.  What is the difference?
