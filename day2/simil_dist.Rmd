## Irish Budget Speeches

In this exercise, you will implement an analysis of similarity between speakers and parties in Irish parliamentary budget speeches.


### Exercise

1. Create a dfm from `data_corpus_irishbudget2010`.

```{r}

```

2. Group it by party and run `textstat_simil()`.

```{r}

```

3. What parties are most similar?

```{r}

```

4. Do the substantive conclusion change when removing stopwords and punctuation, and stemming the dfm?

```{r}

```

5. What words are most similar to "Christmas"?

Hints:
- You can compare a dfm to another partial dfm by specifying `y = x[, "christmas"]`
- Don't forget to specify `margin = "features"` argument
- An easy way to get the top listed matches is using `as.list(n = 10)`

```{r}

```
