```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "##",
  fig.path = "images/"
)
```


## Load the package

```{r}
library("quanteda")
```


## Reproduce example in **quanteda**

Create a text corpus:
```{r, message=FALSE}
# Create text corpus
corp <- corpus(c("A corpus is a set of documents.",
                   "This is the second document in the corpus."))
```

_Exercise: Create this corpus and get a summary using `summary(corp)`._

```{r}

```

Create some tokens:
```{r}

```

Create a document-feature matrix:
```{r}

```

_Question: How does the dfm change when we change the preprocessing steps?_


## Multiple ways to do the same thing

The following expressions result in the same output:

```{r}

```

and

```{r}

```

At what stage were the word features lowercased?
